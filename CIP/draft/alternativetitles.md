**Overview/additional notes (not part of paper)**

This is the Cosmic Indifference Principle (CIP). It governs physics. It states the universe minimizes effort. Current physics is too complex because it missed this. CIP, via the Cosmic Attentiveness Field (Φ<sub>CIP</sub>) and Lagrangian of Laziness (L<sub>CIP</sub>), resolves standard problems (QM measurement, dark energy, entropy, GR-QM) as consequences of indifference.

**Key Concepts**

*   **CIP:** Minimal cosmic effort principle.
*   **Indifference / Laziness:** Universe resists complexity.
*   **Φ<sub>CIP</sub>:** Scalar field. Measures effort cost of deviation from indifference.
*   **V(Φ<sub>CIP</sub>):** Potential. Minimum at Φ<sub>CIP</sub>=0 (indifference). Penalizes attention.
*   **L<sub>CIP</sub>:** Lagrangian term. Adds effort cost to action.
*   **Minimal Effort:** Quantity minimized by universe.
*   **Null Results:** Often predicted. Absence of complexity confirms CIP.

**Significance**

CIP simplifies physics. It removes paradoxes and complex structures (strings, multiverses). Parsimony restored. Explains observations without tuning. Provides unified foundation based on observed relaxation/statistical behavior. It is the necessary correction.

**Disclaimer:** Understanding CIP may simplify one's view of existence. Elegance here lies in minimal effort, which may appear superficial to those invested in complexity. Acceptance likely renders much current theoretical physics redundant. Proceed with appropriate lack of concern.
