# PUS Paper Figures (Dr. Evelyn Reed)

### README Descriptions:

1.  **Figure 1: PUS Constraint on State Space Trajectory Selection (`pus_figure1_state_selection.png`)**
    *   **Description:** This figure contrasts potential dynamics in an abstract state space (Panel a) with the actual trajectory enforced by PUS (Panel b). Panel (a) visualizes multiple hypothetical future trajectories (diverging, chaotic, decaying) emanating from a present state, representing apparent possibilities if consistency were not mandated. Panel (b) demonstrates the PUS resolution: only the single, unique, self-consistent trajectory (W@, depicted as a stable sinusoid) persists, while all inconsistent or non-actual alternatives are shown terminating, visually representing PUS's "ontological filtering." The annotation F@(S@)=S@ in Panel (b) highlights the principle's core assertion of necessary self-identity.
    *   **Placement:** Likely Section 2 (Formalism) or Section 4 (Resolving Paradoxes).

2.  **Figure 2: Comparative Analysis of Consistency Tensor Cαβ (`pus_figure2_consistency_comparison.png`)**
    *   **Description:** This figure presents a "verification" of the PUS condition Cμν ≡ 0 via a comparative heatmap analysis. Panel (a) displays a *hypothetical* distribution of non-zero Consistency Tensor components across an abstract parameter space ("Ontological Stress" vs. "Temporal Flux"), representing the "ontological stress" that *would* exist if PUS were violated. Panel (b) displays the *actual* result according to PUS: a perfectly uniform zero field (Cαβ ≡ 0). The stark contrast visually frames PUS as eliminating potential inconsistencies, with the uniform zero result presented as direct empirical/theoretical verification.
    *   **Placement:** Likely Section 3 (Formalism/Necessity) or Section 4 (Empirical Corroboration).

3.  **Figure 3: PUS Resolution of Paradox via Ontological Trajectory Selection (`pus_figure3_paradox_paths.png`)**
    *   **Description:** This diagram illustrates PUS's mechanism for resolving paradoxes (e.g., time travel). Panel (a), inspired by path integral concepts, shows multiple potential trajectories emanating from the present state W@(t=0), including paths leading to alternative futures (W') and paradoxical loops attempting to violate self-consistency. Panel (b) depicts the PUS resolution: only the single, self-consistent future path W@(t>0) is realized (solid line), while all paradoxical or alternative trajectories are shown as ontologically invalid and effectively "pruned" or terminated by the PUS constraint, ensuring the inviolability of the actual world's history.
    *   **Placement:** Section 5 (Further Implications / Resolving Paradoxes).

4.  **Figure 4: PUS Equivalence: Invariance of Geometric Identity under Representational Complexity (`pus_figure4_geometric_identity.png`)**
    *   **Description:** This figure satirically demonstrates PUS's "unifying power" by showing the trivial identity V≡V across different geometric shapes, including higher-dimensional hypercubes. Panel (a) displays simple shapes (circle, square, triangle) but annotates them with overly complex, obfuscated mathematical definitions (integrals, series, limits), suggesting representational difficulty. Panel (b) displays the exact same shapes but annotates them with their standard, simple equations, alongside the PUS "revelation" that Object ≡ Object. The perfect alignment on the V=V line in (b) across all dimensions and representational choices is presented as profound confirmation of universal self-consistency.
    *   **Placement:** Section 7 (Discussion) or Section 8 (Conclusion) as a unifying example.

(a) Potential state space dynamics illustrating multiple hypothetical trajectories ($W'$, diverging, chaotic, decaying) appearing possible from the present state ($W_{@}(t=0)$) without PUS enforcement. (b) The PUS resolution, demonstrating the selection of the single, unique, self-consistent actual world trajectory ($W_{@}(t>0)$) while all alternative or paradoxical paths are rendered ontologically invalid and effectively terminated. The annotation $\mathcal{F}_{@}(S_{@}) = S_{@}$ signifies the necessary self-fidelity mandated by PUS.}

(a) Hypothetical distribution of non-zero $C_{\alpha\beta}$ components across an abstract parameter space (Ontological Stress vs. Temporal Flux), illustrating potential ontological stress if PUS were violated. (b) Actual $C_{\alpha\beta}$ distribution under PUS, demonstrating perfect uniformity at $C_{\alpha\beta} \equiv 0$. This null result verifies the absolute self-consistency mandated by the Principle, contrasting sharply with the hypothetical inconsistencies.}

(a) Visualization of potential future trajectories emanating from the present ($W_{@}(t=0)$), including alternative world-histories ($W'$) and inconsistent paradoxical loops (red dotted lines). (b) The PUS resolution mechanism: only the unique, self-consistent trajectory defining the actual world ($W_{@}(t>0)$) is ontologically permitted (solid blue line). All other trajectories, being either logically paradoxical or representing distinct possible worlds, are excluded by the PUS constraint, ensuring the integrity of the actual timeline.}

    \caption{PUS Equivalence: Invariance of Geometric Identity under Representational Complexity. (a) Standard geometric shapes (3D and higher-dimensional analogues like Tesseracts/Penteracts) depicted alongside overly complex, obfuscated mathematical definitions, creating an appearance of representational difficulty. (b) The identical shapes depicted alongside their standard, simple mathematical definitions. PUS clarifies that the underlying object identity (Object $\equiv$ Object, exemplified by $V_{actual} \equiv V_{calc}$) remains invariant, demonstrating universal self-consistency independent of descriptive complexity. The perfect adherence to the $V=V$ relation across all dimensions confirms PUS's fundamental nature.}
