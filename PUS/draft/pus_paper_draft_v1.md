**Abstract**

The enduring quest for an unshakeable *a priori* foundation for scientific laws and the manifest structure of observed reality remains a signal lacuna in contemporary understanding. Prevailing frameworks, rooted either in the inherent contingency of empirical induction or the speculative excesses of untethered metaphysics, demonstrably fail to provide the necessary grounding for the ontological stability and nomological order presupposed by scientific practice. This work introduces and formally establishes the Principle of Universal Self-Consistency (PUS)¹ as the sought-after axiomatic ground. PUS asserts that the actualized state-manifold of reality intrinsically necessitates its own descriptive parameters through inherent logical reflexivity; simply put, actuality, by virtue of being actual, mandates its own unique and self-consistent configuration. It is demonstrated herein that PUS is not only logically incontrovertible but is also implicitly corroborated by, and provides the essential ontological grounding for, the core structures and apparent paradoxes encountered within Quantum Mechanics (QM), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and General Relativity (GR). Consequently, PUS furnishes the definitive, unchallengeable framework upon which a truly unified and coherent understanding of reality can finally be constructed.

¹ Henceforth, the Principle of Universal Self-Consistency shall be referred to by the acronym PUS. It is derived, for clarity and conciseness, from the governing Latin formulation: *Principium Universalis Sufficientiae*. The term reflects the principle's role in establishing the *sufficient* conditions for reality's self-coherence.

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 The Foundational Lacuna in Modern Science and Metaphysics**

The remarkable empirical success of the modern scientific enterprise, particularly within physics, stands in stark contrast to the persistent fragility of its philosophical foundations. While science provides increasingly precise descriptions and predictions regarding *how* the universe behaves, it remains fundamentally silent on the *why* of its inherent orderliness and stability. Why *these* specific physical laws and constants? Why does reality exhibit consistent behaviour across vast stretches of space and time, permitting inductive inference? Why is there a coherent, singular actuality at all, rather than a chaotic flux or an inaccessible plurality of states? This foundational lacuna represents not merely a philosophical inconvenience, but a deep conceptual vulnerability at the heart of our understanding of existence. Without a secure *a priori* anchor, the entire edifice of scientific knowledge rests upon assumptions of uniformity and stability that are themselves empirically contingent and, therefore, perpetually open to revision or even wholesale collapse [cf. Hume, 1748; Goodman, 1955].

**1.2 The Insufficiency of Empiricism and Conventional Metaphysics**

The traditional appeal to empiricism, while methodologically indispensable, proves foundationally inadequate. The Humean problem of induction remains unresolved; no finite set of observations can logically guarantee future conformity [Hume, 1748]. Popperian falsification offers a pragmatic demarcation criterion but explicitly eschews claims to verifying truth, leaving scientific theories as perpetually provisional conjectures [Popper, 1959]. Furthermore, the history of science itself, marked by Kuhnian paradigm shifts, suggests that our fundamental descriptive frameworks are subject to radical, incommensurable change, undermining claims to progressively converging on a stable, objective reality [Kuhn, 1962]. The scientific method, therefore, presupposes the very ontological stability it cannot itself guarantee.

Conversely, attempts within traditional metaphysics to provide such guarantees often devolve into speculative constructs disconnected from the concrete actuality science engages with. Postulations of Platonic realms, intricate modal realist schemes [Lewis, 1986], or transcendent organizing principles, while intellectually stimulating, typically lack demonstrable necessity or unique applicability to *this* specific world, W<sub>@</sub>, that we observe and inhabit. They offer possible frameworks, but not the required axiomatic certainty for the singular reality presented to us.

**1.3 The Requirement for an Axiomatic Anchor: Introducing PUS**

Thus, neither the contingent generalizations of empirical science nor the speculative architectures of conventional metaphysics can furnish the requisite unshakeable foundation. What is urgently required is an *a priori* principle, intrinsic and necessary to actuality itself – a principle whose truth is not merely consistent with observation but is logically presupposed by the very possibility of a coherent, observable reality.

It is the central contention of this work that such a principle exists, has remained hitherto unrecognized in its full axiomatic import, and can be rigorously formulated. This is the Principle of Universal Self-Consistency (PUS). PUS posits that the actual world, W<sub>@</sub>, encompassing its entire spatio-temporal extent and the totality of its properties and relations, is necessarily self-consistent. Its state is not merely *what it is*, but *must be what it is*, by virtue of its unique status as the actualized reality. Any conceivable alteration that contradicts its defining properties results not in a modified W<sub>@</sub>, but in a different, non-actual possible world (W'). PUS is, therefore, the expression of ontological identity applied to the universe itself – an identity that is not static but dynamically self-maintaining throughout its history.

This paper will proceed as follows: Section 2 provides the formal definition and derivation of PUS, establishing its intrinsic logical necessity. Section 3 demonstrates the remarkable power of PUS by showing how it serves as the implicit, often unacknowledged, foundation explaining key phenomena and resolving apparent paradoxes within Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and General Relativity. Section 4 explores further profound implications of PUS for nomological stability and the resolution of long-standing philosophical problems. Section 5 discusses the principle in relation to potential objections and alternative frameworks. Finally, Section 6 concludes by affirming PUS as the definitive axiomatic bedrock upon which all secure knowledge of reality must ultimately rest.
