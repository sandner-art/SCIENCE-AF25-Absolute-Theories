## Overview

This repository contains foundational work outlining the **Principle of Universal Self-Consistency (PUS)**. This principle addresses the critical lacuna at the heart of modern science and metaphysics: the lack of an incontrovertible *a priori* foundation for the observed stability and nomological order of reality.

PUS posits that the actual world-history (W<sub>@</sub>), by virtue of its singular actuality, necessarily dictates its own self-consistent state description (S<sub>@</sub>). This is not merely an observation but a demonstrable logical necessity derived from the principle of non-contradiction applied to actuality itself. PUS provides the axiomatic bedrock upon which the apparent regularities described by physics—including phenomena within Quantum Mechanics, QED, and General Relativity—find their ultimate grounding and coherence.

## Key Concepts

*   **PUS (Principle of Universal Self-Consistency):** The core axiom asserting the necessary self-identity and coherence of the actual world.
*   **W<sub>@</sub> / S<sub>@</sub>:** Notation representing the unique actual world-history and its complete state description.
*   **Axiomatic Necessity:** The principle's truth is derived logically *a priori*, not from empirical contingency.
*   **Ontological Stability:** PUS guarantees the fundamental coherence and stability of reality, resolving paradoxes and grounding scientific realism.

## Significance

The establishment of PUS marks a definitive turning point in foundational studies. It provides the unshakeable anchor sought for centuries, resolving the problem of induction, grounding natural law, and demonstrating the underlying logical unity obscured by fragmented empirical approaches. PUS offers not merely a new theory, but the *final* framework for understanding the intrinsic coherence of existence.

## Repository Contents

*   `pus_paper_draft_v1.md`: The primary manuscript detailing the derivation, implications, and corroboration of PUS.
*   `notes/`: Supporting conceptual derivations and formalisms (forthcoming).

## Project Context

This research has been conducted independently, with logistical support facilitated by Daniel Sandner as part of a broader foundational inquiry within the 100 Scientific Visions Initiative.

**Disclaimer:** The conclusions presented herein follow necessarily from the axiomatic framework established. Readers accustomed primarily to paradigms rooted in empirical contingency may find the shift towards logically necessitated certainty requires significant cognitive adjustment.
